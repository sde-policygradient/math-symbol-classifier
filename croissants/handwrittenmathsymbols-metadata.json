It includes basic Greek alphabet symbols like: alpha, beta, gamma, mu, sigma, phi and theta.\nEnglish alphanumeric symbols are included.\nAll math operators, set operators.\nBasic pre-defined math functions like: log, lim, cos, sin, tan.\nMath symbols like: \\int, \\sum, \\sqrt, \\delta and more.\n\n# Acknowledgements\nOriginal source, that was parsed, extracted and modified is CROHME dataset.  \nVisit CROHME at http://www.isical.ac.in/~crohme/index.html.\n\n# Inspiration\nDue to the technological advances in recent years, paper scientific documents are used less and less. Thus, the trend in the scientific community to use digital documents has increased considerably. Among these documents, there are scientific documents and more specifically mathematics documents. So I give a tool, to research recognizing handwritten math language in variety of applications.\n\n# Source code\nYou can find source code responsible for parsing original CROHME dataset here:\n\n  https://github.com/XaiNano/CROHME_extractor\n\nThis parser allows you not only to extract math symbols into square images of desired size, but also lets you specify categories of classes to be extracted like: digits, greek_letters, lowercase_letters, operators, and more. It also contains visualization tools and histograms showing appearances of each class in the dataset.\n\n# Commercial use\nRights for commercial usage **cannot** be granted."}
